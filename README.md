## 📣 Project ElectraVote

 ElectraVote:

ElectraVote leverages the Scroll zkEVM Layer 2 solution to ensure enhanced security and scalability through zero-knowledge proofs. Unlike traditional voting systems, ElectraVote offers immutable and transparent record-keeping, ensuring votes are tamper-proof and verifiable. Our novel approach combines the benefits of blockchain technology with privacy-preserving cryptographic techniques, making it suitable for large-scale elections, especially in regions with limited infrastructure.
